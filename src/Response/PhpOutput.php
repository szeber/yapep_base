     *                           timestamp so is in number of seconds since the
     *                           epoch. In other words, you'll most likely set
     *                           this with the time() function plus the number of
     *                           seconds before you want it to expire. Or you

     *                           omitted, the cookie will expire at the end of the
     *                           session (when the browser closes).
     * @param string $path       The path on the server in which the cookie will
     *                           be available on. If set to '/', the cookie will
     *                           be available within the entire domain. If set to
     *                           '/foo/', the cookie will only be available within
     *                           the /foo/ directory and all sub-directories such
     *                           as /foo/bar/ of domain. The default value is the

     *                           in.
     * @param string $domain     The domain that the cookie is available to. To
     *                           make the cookie available on all subdomains of
     *                           example.com (including example.com itself) then
     *                           you'd set it to '.example.com'. Although some
     *                           browsers will accept cookies without the initial
     *                           ., RFC 2109 requires it to be included. Setting
     *                           the domain to 'www.example.com' or
     *                           '.www.example.com' will make the cookie only
     *                           available in the www subdomain.
     * @param bool   $secure     Indicates that the cookie should only be
     *                           transmitted over a secure HTTPS connection from the
     *                           client. When set to TRUE, the cookie will only be
     *                           set if a secure connection exists.
     * @param bool   $httpOnly   When TRUE the cookie will be made accessible only
     *                           through the HTTP protocol. This means that the
     *                           cookie won't be accessible by scripting
     *                           languages, such as JavaScript. It has been
     *                           suggested that this setting can effectively help
     *                           to reduce identity theft through XSS attacks
     *                           (although it is not supported by all browsers),
     *                           but that claim is often disputed.
